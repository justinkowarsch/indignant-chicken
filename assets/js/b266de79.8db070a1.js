Non-compliance will result in immediate credential revocation and a stern talking-to.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 1: Pre-Migration Password Inventory\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore migrating to SSO, you must catalog all existing passwords using Form SSO-001: \\"Complete Digital Identity Audit.\\" List every password you\'ve ever created, including the ones you forgot. Dietrich needs to verify that you\'re sufficiently confused before proceeding.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Required Information:**\\r\\n\\r\\n- All passwords from 2019-present (exact spelling, including typos)\\r\\n- Security questions you can\'t possibly remember the answers to\\r\\n- That one password you definitely wrote down somewhere but can\'t find\\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 2: Account Linking Ceremony\\r\\n\\r\\nNavigate to the SSO portal and begin the sacred ritual of \\"account linking.\\" You\'ll need to prove you own accounts you\'ve been using for years by receiving verification codes sent to email addresses you no longer have access to.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Important**: Dietrich has programmed the system to require verification from your old college email. \\"It builds character,\\" he says.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 3: Master Password Creation\\r\\n\\r\\nCreate the One Password to Rule Them All\u2122. It must meet these requirements:\\r\\n\\r\\n- 16+ characters including symbols Dietrich personally finds aesthetically pleasing\\r\\n- Cannot contain any word that exists in any language (including made-up ones)\\r\\n- Must be memorable enough to type 47 times per day\\r\\n- Cannot be similar to any password you\'ve used since birth\\r\\n\\r\\n**Pro Tip**: Dietrich suggests using the first letter of each word in your grandmother\'s favorite recipe, combined with the atomic number of your spirit element.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 4: Two-Factor Setup Inception\\r\\n\\r\\nConfigure your authentication app to send codes to your phone, which will require you to authenticate through the app to view the codes needed to authenticate. Dietrich calls this \\"security recursion\\" and is very proud of the concept.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Additional Requirements:**\\r\\n\\r\\n- Backup codes must be printed and stored in a fireproof safe\\r\\n- Safe combination must be different from all other passwords\\r\\n- Safe location must be approved by Dietrich\'s feng shui consultant\\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 5: The Great Migration\\r\\n\\r\\nBegin logging into your applications using SSO. Each app will redirect you through 3-7 intermediate pages before asking you to log in again \\"just to be sure.\\" This is normal. Dietrich designed it this way because \\"security is a journey, not a destination.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n**Expected Redirects**:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. SSO Portal \u2192 Identity Verification Hub\\r\\n2. Identity Hub \u2192 Trust Confirmation Center\\r\\n3. Trust Center \u2192 Dietrich\'s Personal Approval Dashboard\\r\\n4. Back to the app (maybe)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 6: Session Management Mastery\\r\\n\\r\\nYour session will expire every 12 minutes to \\"maintain optimal security posture.\\" When this happens, don\'t panic. Simply re-authenticate using your Master Password, wait for the 2FA code, solve Dietrich\'s daily riddle, and prove you\'re still human via CAPTCHA.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Dietrich\'s Daily Riddles Include**:\\r\\n\\r\\n- \\"What has four legs in the morning and represents a critical security vulnerability?\\"\\r\\n- \\"If a user logs in the forest and Dietrich isn\'t there to verify it, did it really happen?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n<DietrichTipGenerator />\\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 7: Troubleshooting (The Eternal Phase)\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen (not if) something goes wrong, submit a ticket to Dietrich using the Secure Help Portal. Access requires SSO authentication, naturally. Dietrich will respond within 3-5 business days with a detailed explanation of why your problem is actually a feature.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Common \\"Features\\"**:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Spontaneous logouts during important presentations\\r\\n- Password fields that reject your correct password \\"for security reasons\\"\\r\\n- Authentication loops that would make Escher weep\\r\\n\\r\\n## Test Your New Password\\r\\n\\r\\n<PasswordComplexityCalculator />\\r\\n\\r\\n## Footnotes\\r\\n\\r\\n\xb9 Dietrich maintains that if you can remember your password easily, it\'s obviously not secure enough.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n:::info Version History\\r\\n\\r\\n- v2.4.7: Added Step 6 after users complained about \\"excessive productivity\\"\\r\\n- v2.4.6: Increased session timeout frequency per Dietrich\'s meditation retreat insights\\r\\n- v2.4.5: Removed \\"Skip Authentication\\" Easter egg that Dietrich accidentally left in\\r\\n\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n_This guide is considered classified until you\'ve successfully logged in to read it.

Use Form PPI-01: \\"Declaration of Intent to Potentially Submit a Future Form.\\" Must be signed in blue ink<sup id=\\"fn1\\"><a href=\\"#footnote1\\">1</a></sup> and scanned upside-down at exactly 300 DPI (Brenda can tell the difference).\\r\\n\\r\\n**Warning**: Do not CC Brenda on the email. Reply-all instead. She prefers to be surprised by her own involvement.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 2: Initiation of Form Request Form\\r\\n\\r\\nTo request the form needed to initiate the project, submit a **Form Request Form (FRF)**. Do not use the actual initiation form prematurely. That\'s initiative. We don\'t reward that here. Brenda will evaluate your tone, font choice, and whether you used \\"please\\" the correct number of times (3.5 - rounded up) before issuing the real form.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Pro Tip**: Brenda\'s preferred email subject line format is: \\"URGENT: Non-Urgent Request for Future Consideration [PLEASE IGNORE]\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 3: Perform the Ritual\\r\\n\\r\\nSchedule a 15-minute Teams meeting with Brenda. She won\'t attend. This is symbolic. Like a corporate s\xe9ance. Take notes. Nothing is said, but it\'s important that you\'re seen _trying_.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 4: Fill Out the Form (But Not Really)\\r\\n\\r\\nYou\'ll be given a PDF with 47 fields, 6 of which contradict each other. Important fields include:\\r\\n\\r\\n- The client\'s astrological sign (Brenda\'s office plant, Phil, must approve)\\r\\n- The budget Brenda believes you should have (hint: it\'s always 30% less than what you need)\\r\\n- The Project Title (Format: [Client Initials] \u2013 [Vision Statement] \u2013 [2025 Rev3 Aspirational Placeholder])\\r\\n- Your manager\'s mother\'s maiden name (for \\"security purposes\\")\\r\\n- The exact time you realized this project was necessary (to the microsecond)\\r\\n- A haiku describing your feelings about synergy\\r\\n\\r\\n**Important**: Field #23 (\\"Reason for Existing\\") cannot be left blank, but any answer will be marked as incorrect.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 5: Submit to The System\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will enter 3 fields in the app. This is fine. Brenda will immediately overwrite them \\"for consistency.\\" Then she\'ll email you asking why you didn\'t follow the form.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 6: Apologize\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivately and sincerely acknowledge that you were wrong. Brenda was right. Brenda is always right. Your calendar will automatically schedule a **Form Review Reflection Session**. BYOF (Bring Your Own Form).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apology must be submitted in triplicate using the **Contrition Expression Template (CET)**. Brenda will grade it based on sincerity, font size, and whether you remembered to apologize for things you haven\'t done yet.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 7: The Waiting Game\\r\\n\\r\\nYour project will enter the \\"Pending Review\\" phase, which is corporate purgatory. Brenda will review it when Mercury is in retrograde, or when she finishes her current crossword puzzle, whichever comes last.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Status Updates Available**:\\r\\n\\r\\n- \\"Under Review\\" (Brenda hasn\'t looked at it)\\r\\n- \\"In Progress\\" (Brenda has looked at it but disagrees with your font choice)\\r\\n- \\"Needs Clarification\\" (Brenda wants you to guess what\'s wrong)\\r\\n- \\"Approved with Conditions\\" (Congratulations, you may now restart from Step 1)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Footnotes\\r\\n\\r\\n<small id=\\"footnote1\\">\\r\\n  <sup>1</sup> Blue ink must be specifically \\"Corporate Blue #4\\" or \\"Sadness\\r\\n  Blue.\\" No substitutions.

(PLN),\\" \\"Internal Cost Flow Delta (ACT),\\" and a field called \\"Unbucketed Pool Discrepancy.\\" You nod, pretending to understand, while quietly Googling what a \\"delta delta variance\\" is.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe totals don\'t match the overview screen. They don\'t even match _each other_. Somewhere, deep in a Kafkaesque settings menu, there\'s a flag that determines whether costs are shown in actuals, estimates, projected actuals, or metaphorical intent.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour manager asks, \\"So what\'s the burn rate?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo which you reply, \\"Spiritual or financial?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, in the last cell of the last column, something glimmers. A value that looks... plausible. Maybe. You copy it into Excel. Then another. They don\'t agree, but neither does your boss and the budget office, so at least it\'s consistent.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou massage the numbers into a slide, round them off where they refuse to make sense, and assign colors that suggest intention. Green is always comforting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe deck goes out. Nobody questions it. The finance team forwards it to leadership. Leadership sends it to their vendor contact to show how well the tool is working. The vendor captures it as a \u201csuccess story\u201d in their CRM app another vendor sold them that they secretly hate.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou\'ve become a node in the great data laundering machine.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou close the tab. You don\'t log back in. You don\'t need to.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe app wasn\'t built to illuminate. It was built to _obscure_, with plausible precision \u2014 to keep the money flowing, the questions buried, and the blame decentralized.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomewhere, a sales rep earns a bonus.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou sit quietly, wondering if your next report will also come with a CAPTCHA to prove you\'re still human.\\r\\n\\r\\n**The Oracle of Someone Else\u2019s Fortune**: It always foretold prosperity \u2014 just never yours.\\r\\n\\r\\n<LegalNoticeDisclaimer />"},{"id":"/case-study/misdemeanors_and_misdirection","metadata":{"permalink":"/case-study/misdemeanors_and_misdirection","source":"@site/blog/case_studies/2025-07-16-misdemeanors-and-misdirection.mdx","title":"Case Study - Misdemeanors and Misdirection","description":"The last dollar in my pocket says the founders of WerkdayTM have never used their own product.","date":"2025-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Case Study","permalink":"/tags/case-studies","description":"Case Study"}],"readingTime":3.71,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Ernest Sludge","title":"Yours Truly","url":"/ernest-sludge","page":{"permalink":"/authors/ernest-sludge"},"imageURL":"/img/sludge_grumpy.png","key":"es"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"/case-study/misdemeanors_and_misdirection","title":"Case Study - Misdemeanors and Misdirection","authors":["es"],"date":"2025-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["cs"],"draft":false},"unlisted":false,"lastUpdatedAt":1752863082000,"prevItem":{"title":"Case Study - The Oracle of Someone Else\'s Fortune","permalink":"/case-study/the_oracle_of_someone_elses_fortune"},"nextItem":{"title":"Field Note 001 - One-Time Registration Codes","permalink":"/field-note/one-time_registration_codes"}},"content":"import RatingSelector from \\"@site/src/components/RatingSelector\\";\\r\\nimport RatingSwitcher from \\"@site/src/components/RatingSwitcher\\";\\r\\nimport LegalNoticeDisclaimer from \\"@site/src/components/LegalNoticeDisclaimer\\";\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last dollar in my pocket says the founders of Werkday<sup>TM</sup> have never used their own product.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n:::warning\\r\\n\\r\\nThis post might be a bit much for sensitive ears.\\r\\n\\r\\n<RatingSelector />\\r\\n\\r\\n<RatingSwitcher word=\\"Shit fucking\\" /> happens.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n## The Proclamation\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s the Monday prior to payday which means you have an obligation to pay obeisance to the payroll overlords.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::info[_Revised_ Royal Decree]\\r\\n\\r\\nBe it thus known that henceforth all hourly employees shall have their timesheets approved by their reeve no later than 10:00am on moon\'s day.

These are the moment-to-moment chronicles of organizational life: form-filling, checkbox-clicking, and synergy so passive it might be declared legally inert.\\n\\n> Think of them as corporate haikus \u2014 if haikus wore badge lanyards and had to submit time sheets.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udcc9 System-antics Analysis\\n\\nWhere we dissect organizational systems with the precision of forensic accountants and the emotional damage of someone who\u2019s had their password reset 14 times this month.\\n\\nEach analysis begins with a question like, \u201cWhat was the goal here?\u201d and ends with a diagram shaped suspiciously like a M\xf6bius strip. We cover everything from approval chains that loop back on themselves, to workflows that require VPN, Wi-Fi, blood type, and a goat.\\n\\n> **Ernest\u2019s Notes**<br/>\\n> \u201cObserve the middle manager in his native habitat \u2014 forwarding an email with no added context. He believes this act contributes to the project. The others nod in silence, for they, too, are trapped.\u201d\\n\\nExpect slides, citations, and mild weeping.\\n\\n## \ud83d\uddc2\ufe0f Case Studies in Absurdity\\n\\nMeticulously documented failures, miscommunications, and procedural horrors \u2014 presented in the cold, clinical tone of someone who\u2019s already filed six JIRA tickets about it. Each case is real, anonymized, and somehow approved by three managers and a compliance squirrel.\\n\\nExpect exhibits, timelines, and flowcharts that defy Euclidean geometry.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udea8 Sludge Alerts\\n\\nUrgent bulletins from the ever-expanding frontier of organizational absurdity. Here we track the latest threats to sanity and productivity: freshly minted acronyms, AI-generated workflows, \u201cculture reset\u201d campaigns, and compliance trainings that autoplay at full volume in open offices.\\n\\nEach alert is verified by at least one baffled employee and a secondhand Slack screenshot.\\n\\n> If it smells like \u201cinnovation\u201d but feels like d\xe9j\xe0 vu and nausea, it\u2019s probably a Sludge Alert.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## So, What Is \u201cSludge\u201d?\\n\\nSludge is more than inefficiency. It\u2019s a lifestyle. A vibe. A moist ecosystem of unspoken rules, expired SharePoint links, and ritual suffering dressed up as \u201cprocess improvement.\u201d\\n\\nIt\u2019s the project kickoff where nothing is kicked off.<br/>\\nIt\u2019s the policy that contradicts the other policy.<br/>\\nIt\u2019s the sixth status meeting this week about a thing that isn\u2019t happening.<br/>\\nIt\'s the alignment meeting where the client isn\'t sure why you\'re meeting in the first place, but they need you...for something.\\n\\nSludge is the moment you realize everyone in the meeting is looking at a different version of the same spreadsheet and no one will admit it.\\n\\nWe don\u2019t fix sludge.\\nWe document it.\\nWe name it.\\nWe baptize it in sarcasm and send it back into the world like a flaming HR memo.\\n\\n---\\n\\n\ud83e\udde0 Written by _Ernest Sludge_ \u2014 a man of no fixed office, powered by expired coffee pods and righteous indignation. He is definitely not watching you fill out that compliance training for the fourth time this year.\\n\\n\ud83e\udeb5 If you\u2019re reading this, you\u2019re probably already neck-deep. Welcome.
