- Single sign on (SSO), it sounds like a good idea, and it kind of is, in concept.
- Ooh, I just had an idea...keys to a house. And everything within the house as a lock. The cabinets, kitchen faucet,
- Windows: you log in to the computer once you sit down.
- Application And then, you have to log in to damn near every application thereafter, thankfully, it's usually with this same log in info, hence the SSO, with few and minor exceptions.
- Online: To add insult to injury, you usually have to log into _MicroSoft_ products online, even though you're logged in to the Microsoft product you're using to access the internet (I am aware that there might be some systemic/structural things that prohibit OS login credentials from being utilized). And of course, every online application the company uses, you have to login to.
- Irony: "single sign" on is a misnomer, you don't sign in just one single time, you actually sign in all day long into a thousand different things, you just get to use the _same_ log in credentials.
- Problem: you have to sign in a million times a day to do your job.
- More insult: many of these SSO attempts will verify your attempt by calling, texting, or emailing you yet another misnomer, the one-time code. It's a misnomer, because it gives the impression you'll only need it once and for all, but you'll actually need this several times throughout the day, if, of course, you've decided to comply with and work through these SSO woes.
- A far more sensible, and innovative solution, would be to have a true, genuine, single sign on, where it matters most: accessing the device. For, if you're not authorized to access the device, why would you want/need to authenticate the user? Unless, of course, you were accessing online resources from outside an authorized device.
- This SSO dumbfuckery is like having a single access key to do anything at all in your own home. Want to enter the property? Insert your SSO key into the _branded_ lock we've placed on the entry gate.
  - Enter the front door? Use your key.
  - Make dinner? Key.
  - Want a plate? Key.
  - Need to use the toilet? Key...dammit, we forgot who you were, can you please select a two-factor authentication method to verify your identity? Email, text, phone call, your choice. Enter your one-time pin, now you can insert your key and utilize the toilet.
  - Need to get the dishes done? Getting the picture, yet?
  - Laundry...
  - Adjust the HVAC system...
  - Grab a drink from the fridge...
  - Garrote to go after the HOA pres...maybe this one should remain behind lock and key...
- You might think that access to the house is sufficient authority to access the contents in the house, but owners of the house want to be extra sure you're authorized at each stage. This is a _feature_ not an inconvenience.

I think one of the things that really burns my ass about this stuff is that we get _sold_ on these grand ideas, like security and simplicity (yeah, it's nice to only have one password)...but all decisions have trade offs. Where as before, you had any number of login credentials, you now have one, controlled by a central authentication platform, so IT only has to manage the one. This _is_ a net improvement. But why stop there with the improvement mindset? Why not try and take it a step further? If I can't get into the facility, or onto the machine that accesses these computer-based tools, why bother me with a million login needs if I _am_ authorized to be in your facility and on your machines? I'm not arguing against securing your assets. I'm only arguing against not taking the mentality of improvement as far as it can go.
