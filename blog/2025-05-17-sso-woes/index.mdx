**_Sludge Report Extra: The Art of Corporate Absurdity_**

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**  
April 1st, every day.

_Cubicalis, Inc., the creators of the world’s most innovative security solutions, are thrilled to announce their latest breakthrough: the Single Sign-On (SSO) system. This groundbreaking technology is designed to streamline your login experience, making it easier than ever for you to forget your password every 7.5 minutes._

**“We’ve taken the guesswork out of forgetting your password,”** said Cheryl Excelsior, VP of Credential Fatigue Enablement. **“Now, instead of struggling with multiple logins, you only need to remember one—provided you can recall it long enough to type it before the system logs you out mid-thought.”**

Cheryl added, **“This is the beauty of distributed security. Every app gets its own chance to not trust you, like that one friend who always acts suspicious when you ask them for a favor at 3 PM on a Friday.”**

**Key Benefits:**

1. **One Password to Rule Them All™**:  
   _And yet, here’s the kicker—you’ll be typing it 17 times before lunch, because you need the practice._ "Password reset subsystems and IT Tickets will become a thing of the past making the entire system more streamlined and require less overhead.", says Excelsior.

2. **Session Expiry You Didn’t Ask For**:  
   _Get ready for the thrill of being kicked out of your own dashboard mid-thought. Nothing says productivity like a timeout when you’re in the zone._

3. **Zero Trust, Zero Convenience™**:  
   _A philosophy that’s become a lifestyle and a permanent barrier to getting anything done. It’s like having security guards at every turn, just to make sure you’re still “you.”_

4. **Two-Factor Confusion**:  
   _You’ll get an alert on your phone… which then requires you to log in to view it. Because why have one form of authentication when you can have two?_

5. **Passwordless Login with a Password**:  
   _“It’s passwordless in spirit,” Cheryl clarified, “if you think about it existentially.” So, yeah, still a password, but don’t expect to remember it._

**Rumors that the company’s login strategy was developed by Kafka’s ghost remain unconfirmed. But insiders report upgrades being considered:**

- **Two-Factor Confusion**: You’ll get an alert on your phone… which then requires you to log in to view it. _“It’s like having a locked box with a padlock and a key, but the lock is on the wrong side,”_ Cheryl said.

- **Passwordless Login with a Password**: _Cheryl clarified that it’s “passwordless in spirit” if you consider the existential implications._

- **Seamless Authentication from Your Workstation Login?**  
  _We explored that, but then how would we know you're still you?_

**Employees are encouraged to submit feedback by logging into the new Feedback Portal (SSO required, naturally), navigating through three redirect loops, and solving a CAPTCHA that tests your ability to identify inverted traffic cones in low light.**

_So here’s to Cubicalis, Inc.—solving the problems you didn’t have while successfully driving you to madness. Happy typing!_
