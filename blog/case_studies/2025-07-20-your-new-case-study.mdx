PEAS'N RICE!!!!

....you've unwittingly joined a "task force" tasked with subtly forcing compliance with the status quo.

You probably can't change it, but you can <RatingSwitcher word="damn"/> well roast the <RatingSwitcher word="shit"/> out of it once you figure out what's _really_ going on.

## Welcome to Innovation Theater

Excitement is palpable. The _Process Innovation Management Platform_ team is formed and finally kicking off its efforts...and you have an invite, though you're a tad suspicious of the name. You simultaneously juggle the naming choice and how you're finally going to get to make a difference! You arrive at the kick off meeting, pen, paper, and ice-cold Dr. Pepper.

Then it hits you like a freight train hits a "stalled" Prius, a one-line statement in the team charter splashed on the 2,000" TV..."NOT WITHIN PURVIEW: Delivery of solution-based outcomes" and you know exactly where this <RatingSwitcher word="shit"/> show is going...

One of your neighbors, a Greek chorus of sanity in the world of corporate madness, sees it too and casts a knowing look; he's crystallized the insanity in mere microseconds while you sip Dr. Pepper to conceal your disappointment.

## The Flowchart of Futility

The team leader, colloquially described as _The Weatherman_ unfurls a dreadful **Process Map** in all its pixelated "brilliance". It's a labyrinthine Visio™ flow chart "outlining" the generation, sorting, and delegation of ideas with an appropriate quantity of perfunctory "gates" and "nodes".

Via a PowerApp™ an idea is entered, by users, into the "system", a series of committees evaluate and route the ideas to a PowerBI™ <RatingSwitcher word="hell hole"/> where other people may or may not implement the idea. Otherwise the idea is canned.

Internal "Power Users" will be graced with the opportunity to generate a _new_ PowerApp™ with a new underlying spreadsheet of obviation (whatever that means) and another PowerBI™ dashboard.

For those ideas too sophisticated for the local plebes, the idea is sent off to corporate IT gods for "implementation", likely another SLAP (Spreadsheets Labelled As Programs—because why fix what's clearly broken?) or Workwaste (the enterprise HR app that makes everyone want to waste away) dumpster fire if the new app can survive the New App Authorization Process (NA²P). The place where good ideas go to take a nap, AKA "The Nursery" where all the "adults" just want the toddlers to shut up and take a nap.

This is the moment you felt like Sarah Connor in _Terminator 2_—watching a nuclear blast of bureaucracy incinerate your hopes of real progress.

## Theater All the Way Down

And just when you think the PowerApp™ madness has peaked, you realize the real problem isn't the tools—it's the entire system that creates them.

The beautiful dysfunction: Corporate incentives breed local "solutions" that promote chaos, which ultimately transmutes to pure <RatingSwitcher word="fucking"/> theater.

Can we say "transmute"?

### Corporate Incentives: The Quarterly Earnings Wankathon

Nobody has real power to fix <RatingSwitcher word="shit"/>. That power belongs to suits obsessing over quarterly reports and shareholder value. As long as your business unit bleeds enough profit, there's literally zero incentive to solve problems—even profitable ones. Why fix what ain't broke enough to hurt the stock price?

### Localized Tools: Excel's Prettier Cousin Who Can't Hold a Real Job

Management grudgingly admits efficiency might be nice, you know, theoretically. But enterprise solutions cost real money and require actual decisions. Enter Microsoft™ with their "revolutionary" PowerApps™—Excel's prettier cousin who still can't hold a real job. They've created the thinnest veneer of improvement over the same old spreadsheet <RatingSwitcher word="clusterfuck"/>.

### Only Promotes Chaos: Information Silos and Corporate Guillotines

Zero effort to integrate knowledge because that would require, you know, coordination. Information stays scattered like confetti after a failed product launch. Disruptors get the corporate guillotine faster than you can say "synergistic optimization." So everyone works within the constraints, building Rube Goldberg machines out of PowerBI™ dashboards.

### Only Promotes Theater: The Survival Game

The net effect? Some people discover there's more value in _appearing_ innovative than actually being productive. It's the only game that gets you ahead while keeping your head attached to your shoulders. Others don't play at all—they just duck, cover, and pray the next reorganization doesn't notice them.

:::warning[The Tragic Irony, your seer's key insight]

The _**P**rocess **I**nnovation **M**anagement **P**latform_ never intended to manage innovation at all. They're just pimping out everyone's time for their own process theater.
