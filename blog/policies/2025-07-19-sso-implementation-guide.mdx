Ever wondered why "Single Sign-On" somehow requires you to sign on 47 times per day? Meet Dietrich's revolutionary authentication system, where logging in becomes a spiritual journey through digital purgatory. Warning: May cause existential crisis and sudden urge to become a farmer.

:::warning[Mandatory Compliance Notice]

This document has been approved by Dietrich from IT Security and the Committee for Digital Identity Confusion (CDIC). Non-compliance will result in immediate credential revocation and a stern talking-to.

:::

## Step 1: Pre-Migration Password Inventory

Before migrating to SSO, you must catalog all existing passwords using Form SSO-001: "Complete Digital Identity Audit." List every password you've ever created, including the ones you forgot. Dietrich needs to verify that you're sufficiently confused before proceeding.

**Required Information:**

- All passwords from 2019-present (exact spelling, including typos)
- Security questions you can't possibly remember the answers to
- That one password you definitely wrote down somewhere but can't find

## Step 2: Account Linking Ceremony

Navigate to the SSO portal and begin the sacred ritual of "account linking." You'll need to prove you own accounts you've been using for years by receiving verification codes sent to email addresses you no longer have access to.

**Important**: Dietrich has programmed the system to require verification from your old college email. "It builds character," he says.

## Step 3: Master Password Creation

Create the One Password to Rule Them All™. It must meet these requirements:

- 16+ characters including symbols Dietrich personally finds aesthetically pleasing
- Cannot contain any word that exists in any language (including made-up ones)
- Must be memorable enough to type 47 times per day
- Cannot be similar to any password you've used since birth

**Pro Tip**: Dietrich suggests using the first letter of each word in your grandmother's favorite recipe, combined with the atomic number of your spirit element.

## Step 4: Two-Factor Setup Inception

Configure your authentication app to send codes to your phone, which will require you to authenticate through the app to view the codes needed to authenticate. Dietrich calls this "security recursion" and is very proud of the concept.

**Additional Requirements:**

- Backup codes must be printed and stored in a fireproof safe
- Safe combination must be different from all other passwords
- Safe location must be approved by Dietrich's feng shui consultant

## Step 5: The Great Migration

Begin logging into your applications using SSO. Each app will redirect you through 3-7 intermediate pages before asking you to log in again "just to be sure." This is normal. Dietrich designed it this way because "security is a journey, not a destination."

**Expected Redirects**:

1. SSO Portal → Identity Verification Hub
2. Identity Hub → Trust Confirmation Center
3. Trust Center → Dietrich's Personal Approval Dashboard
4. Back to the app (maybe)

## Step 6: Session Management Mastery

Your session will expire every 12 minutes to "maintain optimal security posture." When this happens, don't panic. Simply re-authenticate using your Master Password, wait for the 2FA code, solve Dietrich's daily riddle, and prove you're still human via CAPTCHA.

**Dietrich's Daily Riddles Include**:

- "What has four legs in the morning and represents a critical security vulnerability?"
- "If a user logs in the forest and Dietrich isn't there to verify it, did it really happen?"

## Step 7: Troubleshooting (The Eternal Phase)

When (not if) something goes wrong, submit a ticket to Dietrich using the Secure Help Portal. Access requires SSO authentication, naturally. Dietrich will respond within 3-5 business days with a detailed explanation of why your problem is actually a feature.

**Common "Features"**:

- Spontaneous logouts during important presentations
- Password fields that reject your correct password "for security reasons"
- Authentication loops that would make Escher weep

## Footnotes

¹ Dietrich maintains that if you can remember your password easily, it's obviously not secure enough.
