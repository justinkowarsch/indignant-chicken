It's the Monday of a payday week. You have to approve your team's time sheets by 10am in one of these lovely applications. Under Menu &rarr; Team &rarr; "Time and Scheduling Hub" it is. Let's give that a try. Win for the app, it happens to be the right place. You see a button that says "Review and Approve Time", "that's _got_ to be it", you think so you click it, you were told to "approve time" after all. A page appears with several fields. Let's go with the default selections, as they seem reasonable. Error.

:::danger[error]

Workers must have the same period schedule. Please modify the group of workers or select a period schedule in the prompt.

:::

Just so you know, that's Klingon for "you did it wrong, good luck fixing it".

Somehow, you configure the multitudinous fields to generate _something_ after playing Twister a bit. But the approve button doesn't do anything. There appears a message on the table explaining why these hours are not approved:

:::warning[reason]

Hours must be submitted before they can be approved.

:::

You call the employee to ask them to submit their time sheet. But they don't have a submit button anywhere on their side of the digital hell-hole. Your colleague next door, overhearing your frustrated outburst, and who has actually read (and remembered) HR's instructions from six months ago, informs you that you don't _approve_ time, you _submit_ time. Approval is for someone else...but _THAT SOMEONE ELSE TOLD ME **I** HAD TO **APPROVE** TIME!_

You get to where you _should_ be by "Enter Time for Worker". A modal pops up asking you which worker. I was just in the table showing the worker's not-approved time...and you don't know to which worker or time period I'm referring!?!

:::tip

Compliance is not always a virtue, but in some cases, it's nice to just get HR off your back...after two reminder emails that you ignore, they'll email your boss, who will email you. It's best to address your boss' email relatively promptly.

Finally, you're there, all that beautiful _un-submitted_ time staring at you.

There's no "Submit" button anywhere on the screen you're on.

Poking around, you find it hidden in pop up tray when you click "Review". Submit that <RatingSwitcher word="shit"/>, finally, once and for all and go have some coffee.

But not before we have a look at some of the alerts the app sees fit to inform me of:

:::warning[alerts]

- On \[date] you arrived early by 8 or more minutes.
- On \[date] you arrived early by 8 or more minutes.
- On \[date] you arrived early by 8 or more minutes.
- On \[date] you arrived early by 8 or more minutes.

Good god, I'm so glad someone is watching out for me! Good catch!
