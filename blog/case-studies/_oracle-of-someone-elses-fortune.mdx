You're asked to report on a project's financial situation. You log into the one sanctioned app for this, hopeful. The "dashboard" greets you like a locked door in a fire drill &mdash; present, but wholly unhelpful, save for the "Most Frequently Used" tiles chosen either by your past desperation or the vendor's dark sense of humor.

Everything else is a scavenger hunt of cryptic alphanumeric codes. You spot the one link that actually leads somewhere, click, and find yourself staring into a data gulag: four columns of fields with labels that whisper in ancient tongues.

:::note

"Dashboard" might be accurate &mdash; if they mean the thing crash test dummies are violently hurled into.

This app's UI is a strip mall of arcane icons. A green checkmark next to a green checkbox next to a green "V" next to a green tick that means "validate" (but not "submit"). You've entered Button Roulette. And there's no jackpot, only warning modals and the creeping sense that you're the product.

:::note

If the field label makes no sense, it's likely because it's _not_ for you &mdash; it's bound directly to a database column name a developer though was self-explanatory...for those who read cuneiform.

Funny thing is, after all this, you forget why you even opened the <RatingSwitcher word="damned"/> app in the first place and you haven't found the info on the project's financial status that you were looking for.

Now that you're in the project financial data detail screen, you're met with a scene straight from the 1986 fever dream _Labyrinth_. You made a wish &mdash; for clarity, a few clean numbers, maybe a basic variance report. Instead, the Goblin King of COB has swooped in, stolen your sanity, and left you with a threat: _"Find the report before the clock runs out... or be transformed into our next Business Analyst."_

The screen mocks you with 26 tabs, each labeled with terms like "Alloc InfoGrp 2" and "WBSE Ref Recycle Pool". You click one. It loads another modal. You click "Back". It loads _two_ modals.

You're not navigating a UI &mdash; you're deciphering a spellbook written by warring factions of a secret school cloistered in a mist-weathered citadel of soaring spires.

At some point, you stare long enough to believe you've found what you're looking for: "Plan vs. Actual Variance Detail," nestled beneath three collapsible menus and a warning that reads, helpfully, _"Totals may vary by source"_. That's fine. You've already accepted that reality is subjective.

See the following simple example:

<details>
  <summary>Important data, click to find it.</summary>

  <details>
    <summary>Important data, click to find it.</summary>

    <details>
      <summary>Important data, click to find it.</summary>

      <details>
        <summary>Important data, click to find it.</summary>

        ðŸ’©
    </details>

    </details>

  </details>

</details>

You squint. You click. You pray. A progress bar appears &mdash; for a moment, it feels like triumph.

But what appears is a table with columns for "Fiscal Period Adj. (PLN)," "Internal Cost Flow Delta (ACT)," and a field called "Unbucketed Pool Discrepancy." You nod, pretending to understand, while quietly Googling what a "delta delta" variance is.

The totals don't match the overview screen. They don't even match _each other_. Somewhere, deep in a Kafkaesque settings menu, there's a flag that determines whether costs are shown in actuals, estimates, projected actuals, or metaphorical intent.

Your manager asks, "So what's the burn rate?"

To which you reply, "Spiritual or financial?"

Finally, in the last cell of the last column, something glimmers. A value that looks...right. You screenshot it, close the app, and whisper to yourself:

> "The report was inside me all along."

You never log in again.

:::note

Use case overload is baked into the app's DNA. Execs buy the dream, never touch the tool, and leave the plebes to interpret modal riddles like some sadistic form of postmodern management while they play golf with the greasy sales man who sold them the app.
