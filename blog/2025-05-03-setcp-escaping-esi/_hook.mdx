## Hook

It was a dark and stormy meeting. All eyes were on you as you hunted for the elusive spreadsheet &mdash; the one you knew, deep in your soul, hadn't been touched since the last time this meeting wasted your life.

There you are, trapped in the labyrinth, traversing the network drive directory structure trying to locate which folder that <RatingSwitcher word="goddamned"/> spreadsheet lives in. No luck in the *NAS*ty hierarchy of mostly empty, deeply nested, and often unadulterated digital dumpsters....then you jump to the equally nasty **_set_** of Teams folders, a maze of its own, of Teams everyone and their mother think you should be on and apparently can't come up with an original name between themselves...or, is it on SharePoint? Or Microsoft OneDrive? Is it my personal OneDrive or the organizational OneDrive? Or, absolutely worst of all, someone's C drive, who, conveniently, is on vacation "with spotty connectivity".

:::note

I have a deep-seated issue with Microsoft's use of the word Team.

The most soul-crushing part of all this? That spreadsheet exists for no other reason than this: the applications the corporate gods deemed "synergistically cross-functional", and "cohesively integrated", are usually such a nightmare to use that the most savvy among us are only really adept at extracting the useful data into...you guessed it..._that <RatingSwitcher word="fucking"/> spreadsheet_...the very thing the monstrous app was supposed to eliminate in the first place. But which spreadsheet is the latest data in? And where <RatingSwitcher word="the hell"/> is it hiding?

If you just ignore _most_ of the email you get when you _are_ at work, it won't ever seem odd that you don't read or reply to them when you're _not_ at work.
