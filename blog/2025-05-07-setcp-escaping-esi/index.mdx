Welcome to **Sarcastic Expeditions Through Corporate Purgatory** (S.E.T.C.P.), I'll be your tour guide today.

Please keep your hands and resignation letters inside the vehicle at all times. We'll be making stops at:

- The *NAS*ty Filesystem Swamp,
- Mount SharePoint-of-No-Return,
- and a brief layover at Vacationer's C-Drive (weather permitting).

If at any point you feel like you're going in circles, don't worry &mdash; that's working as intended.

**In case you were wondering,** here's the official pronunciation of S.E.T.C.P.:

<PronunciationSwitcher word="SETCP" phonetic="set-sup" ipa="sɛtˈsʌp" />

:::note[another note]

The precocious among us will notice that the pronunciation of "SETCP” sounds a lot like a favorite service vendors _love_ to sell: "sets up"...a serendipitous coincidence that no author would ever attempt to contrive.

## Clawing Our Way Out

Grass roots solutions. Not the ones from on high. Let them glean from these solutions what they need, but not force "solutions" down the hierarchy.

## What It Looks Like In Practice

## Closing Thoughts

That concludes today’s expedition. Please exit through the gift shop where we sell laminated copies of your IT ticket and a USB drive with six conflicting spreadsheet versions

:::note

“SETCP” sounds like you’re about to set something up...which is ironically perfect given how much time enterprise software wastes pretending to do just that.

And...I'm off, to conquer another blog post like it's the last spreadsheet on Earth.
