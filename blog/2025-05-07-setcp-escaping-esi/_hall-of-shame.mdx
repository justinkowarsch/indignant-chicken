## The Hall of Shame

I want to begin this journey by priming your mind with a scary truth: the hall of shame is really <RatingSwitcher word="flipping"/> long, and _very_ cluttered. Many of our supposedly beloved applications are likely to find themselves on the hall walls. Though we may not speak of them here, they rightly deserve this criticism. To spare you, my dear reader and future Patreon contributor, I will limit the remainder of this screed to a relatively manageable length.

:::note

Why "supposedly beloved", you might ask yourself? I say it this way because there are some apologists for these hall of shame superstars who have their identities and resumes so tightly coupled to these applications that they, naturally, feel it's in their best interest to defend these _Offenders-of-Sanity_. This faux love is really a love of self &mdash; an instinct for survival which can hardly be faulted, but nonetheless ignored.
