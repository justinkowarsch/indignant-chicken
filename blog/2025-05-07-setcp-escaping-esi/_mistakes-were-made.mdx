<!-- Suggested Heading:  Mistakes Were Made (and Renewed Annually)-->

> Slightly less stinky piles of dog <RatingSwitcher word="shit"/>.

> _Valley of Vendor Lock-In_ with well-worn paths that lead to nowhere, marked by bones of pilot programs past.

> We keep ending up in the same wastelands — not because they’re good, but because they’re just slightly less stinky than the last pile of dog <RatingSwitcher word="shit"/> we stepped in.

> Vendors promise clean paths. Executives squint at ROI. Consultants conjure charts. But on the ground, it's just another expedition through the Valley of Vendor Lock-In, where every path loops back to a new interface with the same old dysfunction.

> The UX changes, the suffering remains.

- inertia
- vendor lock-in
- sunk cost fallacy
- political cover
- decision makers who don't touch what they buy

> It's not stupidity &mdash; it's survival masquerading as strategy.

> No one wants to admit the moat was just decorative.

> The system is busted, sure, but starting over feels like drowning. So everyone just keeps bailing water while pretending this was the plan.

> Whole roles, departments, and job security are built on mastering the rituals of a terrible app. The system become self-preserving &mdash; not because it works, but because _people depend on it not working too well._

> The people who bought the app don't use it. The people who use it didn't choose it.

All these statement give me the vibe I'm going for in crafting this next section.

It starts as a vision. &rarr; Grows into a monster. &rarr; Individual & group livlihood become dependent on this very monstrosity. &rarr; Organization is profitable _enough_, so little motivation or willingness to make a change from those who implemented it, despite the opportunity to become more profitable. But there's a political battle to be waged. Increasing inefficiency will always seem like the elimination of headcount, and people will always fight that. They will also fight upsetting the apple cart so long as they're content to wrestle with the same problem day in and day out. They will also tend to prefer not sticking their neck out for something that could fail.

I need a snarky metaphor to narrate this evolution...

- Dream
- Look for solutions to fulfill need to achieve dream
- Meet a greasy salesman
- Purchase software
- IT rolls out software to the plebes
- Management teams parrot the vision this software will usher in, despite the "growing pains"
- Executive management never touches software
- Plebes keep their mouth shut because they need their jobs
- Pain continues, management teams can't conceal pain from executive management
- Consultants hired to coach plebes on use of software
- Plebes discover workarounds to satisfy needs of business
- Specialists hired/promoted/entrenched into roles to serve needs of quirky software
- Business continues to profit
- Executive management plays golf with software vendor greasy salesman

What kind of metaphor could be used for something such as this, exaggerated though it may be?

- A quest?
- A Rube Goldberg machine?
- A quest that turns into a Rube Goldberg machine.
- A quest for what, for which's attainment, a Rube Goldberg machine is purpose-built?
- What about the hideous Cadillac Ranch in Amarillo, TX? The most stunning aspect are the trash in your field and the spray paint sales at local gift shops. But everyone gets to contribute to the "art work" that's just a series of rusted out automobile carcasses bloated by decades of layered on paint.

Imagine you're the founder of a brand new company. "We need a system", you say to your team of doe-eyed enthusiasts. The Excel invoices, spec sheets, and Word scopes just don't cut it. It's too much tedium, you've got a world to conquer, not a digital mine field.

> _"You used version 2.12.423, it's been superseded by version 3.54.428."_
>
> _"But that's the version in the default folder structure I copied and pasted when I created the project."_
>
> _"Steve, you own the folder structure, when Ernie publishes a revised document, you're supposed to update the folder structure with the new default."_
>
> _"No one ever told me I had to do that. Plus, I have a million other things to keep track of. P"_

It is innocent moments like these that spark the revolution of the regrettable.

A meeting is convened to discuss the inefficiencies. The conversation is a hydra of complaints.
