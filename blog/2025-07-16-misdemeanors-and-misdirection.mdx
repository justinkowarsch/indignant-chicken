The last dollar in my pocket says the founders of Werkday<sup>TM</sup> have never used their own product.

This post might be a bit much for sensitive ears.

<RatingSwitcher word="Shit fucking" /> happens.

## The Proclamation

It's the Monday prior to payday which means you have an obligation to pay obeisance to the payroll overlords.

:::info[Royal Decree]

Be it thus known that henceforth all hourly employees shall have their timesheets approved by their supervisor no later than 10:00am on Monday. Those supervisors failing to meet this deadline will be flogged by email into compliance.

:::

So says the proclamation, and despite your proclivity for rebelliousness, you (try to) comply; it's better than the alternative.

## The Training Mirage

Several months prior to the roll out of Werkday<sup>TM</sup>, the overlords saw fit to begin end user training, which _supposedly_ included training on approving your hourly direct report's timesheets, but it was so <RatingSwitcher word="damn"/> glitchy you only remember mentally checking out to navel gaze and ponder the machinations of insectoids.

## The Illusion of Approval

You decide to give it a go all on your own, poking around the software suite to see if modern software has come far enough since DOS to be mildly intuitive. Reality quickly frags your precarious hopes.

There is no button for approving time anywhere that you can see.

:::note

There are no shortage of buttons, mind you. That's the beauty of modern web apps, layer upon layer of buttons within buttons within buttons. It's genuinely miraculous that the modern dev team can find so many reasons to button-ify your dashboard with so few buttons immediately useful.

:::

Turns out the "Time and Scheduling Hub" is where you need to be, but this is buried under a submenu of a "Menu" button. The "Time and Scheduling Hub" though, is simply a dashboard of more buttons...wait, is that "Review and Approve Time" you see? It was a relatively simple task to get here...

:::danger[error]

Workers must have the same period schedule. Please modify the group of workers or select a period schedule in the prompt.

:::

The prompt:
Date: (today's date)
Review my direct reports only: true
Workers (empty)
Worker Type: Employee
Employee Type: Regular
Show: All Workers
Period Schedule: Empty
Pay Rate Type: Hour

Period schedule has roughly 40 options to select from....but they did provide a handy option: "My Team's Period Schedules".

:::danger[error]

No workers were found; change filter criteria.

:::

Which one?

These error messages feel very cryptic.

Digging out your seer stone, you simply start removing selections one at a time, until you find that if you simply clear _all fields_ and you get an actual search result. That'd be a rather easy default...a blank form that returns a result, rather than a pre-populated form that returns errors.

Moving on.

To your not-so-astonished eyes, you finally find an "Approve" button.

:::danger[error]

Hours must be submitted before they can be approved.

:::

## In Search of the Submit Button

In a desperate race to make it over the finish line before 10am, you visit your direct report's office to ask them to submit the time. Problem solved.

"I don't have a submit button anywhere..."

Satan has escorted you straight into Digital Hell making you wonder just what you did to deserve this fate and perform an inventory of all the wrongs you've committed.

To your relief, your office neighbor, sensing your trepidation, steps in indicating they actually remember the training seminar and that you actually have to _SUBMIT_ the employee's timesheet for them under _Enter Time for Worker_.

How intuitive, you muse.

Alas, no submit button...another button &rarr; submenu &rarr; submenu called "Review reveals the much-sought-after Submit button.

Finally....
