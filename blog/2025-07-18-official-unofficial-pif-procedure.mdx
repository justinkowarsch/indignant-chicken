Ever wondered why starting a simple project requires approval from an office plant named Phil? Welcome to the byzantine world of corporate bureaucracy, where forms need forms, meetings exist purely for symbolic purposes, and your success depends entirely on whether Brenda's coffee is the right temperature. This is the _real_ project initiation process we all know and dread.

<!-- truncate -->

:::warning[Important Notice]

This document has been peer-reviewed by Brenda's coffee mug and approved by the Committee for Prohibiting Traction, Hindering Efficiency, and Forestalling Timelines (CPTHEFT).

:::

## Step 1: Pre-Pre-Approval Coordination

Before initiating a project, confirm with Brenda that you are _thinking about_ initiating a project. Use Form PPI-01: "Declaration of Intent to Potentially Submit a Future Form." Must be signed in blue ink<sup id="fn1"><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> and scanned upside-down at exactly 300 DPI (Brenda can tell the difference).

**Warning**: Do not CC Brenda on the email. Reply-all instead. She prefers to be surprised by her own involvement.

## Step 2: Initiation of Form Request Form

To request the form needed to initiate the project, submit a **Form Request Form (FRF)**. Do not use the actual initiation form prematurely. That's initiative. We don't reward that here. Brenda will evaluate your tone, font choice, and whether you used "please" the correct number of times (3.5 - rounded up) before issuing the real form.

**Pro Tip**: Brenda's preferred email subject line format is: "URGENT: Non-Urgent Request for Future Consideration [PLEASE IGNORE]"

## Step 3: Perform the Ritual

Schedule a 15-minute Teams meeting with Brenda. She won't attend. This is symbolic. Like a corporate séance. Take notes. Nothing is said, but it's important that you're seen _trying_.

## Step 4: Fill Out the Form (But Not Really)

You'll be given a PDF with 47 fields, 6 of which contradict each other. Important fields include:

- The client's astrological sign (Brenda's office plant, Phil, must approve)
- The budget Brenda believes you should have (hint: it's always 30% less than what you need)
- The Project Title (Format: [Client Initials] – [Vision Statement] – [2025 Rev3 Aspirational Placeholder])
- Your manager's mother's maiden name (for "security purposes")
- The exact time you realized this project was necessary (to the microsecond)
- A haiku describing your feelings about synergy

**Important**: Field #23 ("Reason for Existing") cannot be left blank, but any answer will be marked as incorrect.

## Step 5: Submit to The System

You will enter 3 fields in the app. This is fine. Brenda will immediately overwrite them "for consistency." Then she'll email you asking why you didn't follow the form.

## Step 6: Apologize

Privately and sincerely acknowledge that you were wrong. Brenda was right. Brenda is always right. Your calendar will automatically schedule a **Form Review Reflection Session**. BYOF (Bring Your Own Form).

The apology must be submitted in triplicate using the **Contrition Expression Template (CET)**. Brenda will grade it based on sincerity, font size, and whether you remembered to apologize for things you haven't done yet.

## Step 7: The Waiting Game

Your project will enter the "Pending Review" phase, which is corporate purgatory. Brenda will review it when Mercury is in retrograde, or when she finishes her current crossword puzzle, whichever comes last.

**Status Updates Available**:

- "Under Review" (Brenda hasn't looked at it)
- "In Progress" (Brenda has looked at it but disagrees with your font choice)
- "Needs Clarification" (Brenda wants you to guess what's wrong)
- "Approved with Conditions" (Congratulations, you may now restart from Step 1)

## Footnotes

<small id="footnote1">
  <sup>1</sup> Blue ink must be specifically "Corporate Blue #4" or "Sadness
  Blue." No substitutions. Brenda can smell cheap pens.
