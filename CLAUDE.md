# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Docusaurus-based blog website called "theSludge.report" that appears to be a technical blog with field notes and articles. The site is configured as a blog-only setup (no docs section) and uses a custom rating system for content.

## Development Commands

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Local Development

```bash
npm run start
```

Starts development server with hot reload at <http://localhost:3000>

### Build Commands

#### Full Production Build (with PDFs)

```bash
npm run build
```

Generates PDFs first, then builds the site. Use for deployment and when PDF content has changed.

#### Fast Development Build (no PDFs)

```bash
npm run build:fast
```

Builds site only, skipping PDF generation. Use for quick builds when only blog content has changed.

#### PDF Generation Only

```bash
npm run build:pdf-only
# or
npm run generate-pdfs
```

Generates PDFs without building the site. Use when updating PDF content only.

### TypeScript Type Checking

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

Runs TypeScript compiler to check for type errors

### Content Generation

```bash
npm run tsr g fn "Post Title"    # Creates field note
npm run tsr g cs "Study Title"   # Creates case study
npm run tsr help                 # Show generator help
```

Creates new blog posts using the custom generator script:

- **Field Notes** (`fn`): Simple posts in `/blog/field_notes/` with minimal frontmatter
- **Case Studies** (`cs`): Full-featured posts in `/blog/case_studies/` with:
  - Complete scaffold structure (Setup, Problem, Plot Thickens, Resolution, Takeaways)
  - Required component imports (RatingSelector, RatingSwitcher, LegalNoticeDisclaimer)
  - Warning sections and contextual info boxes
  - Footnotes and legal disclaimer sections
  - `draft: true` by default for safe editing

### Deployment

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Runs full build with PDF generation, then deploys to GitHub Pages.

**Important**: Always use `npm run deploy` (not `docusaurus deploy` directly) to ensure PDFs are generated before deployment.

**Windows/Git Bash**: The deploy script uses Unix-style environment variables (`GIT_USER=justinkowarsch`) that work directly in Git Bash without additional packages.

## Architecture

### Content Structure

- **Blog posts**: Located in `/blog/` directory using MDX format
- **Field notes**: Special blog post type with `fn` tag, created via generator script
- **Authors**: Configured in `/blog/authors.yml`
- **Tags**: Configured in `/blog/tags.yml`

### Custom Components

- **Rating System**: Global context provider for content rating ("explicit" vs "pg")
  - `RatingContext.tsx`: Context provider for rating state
  - `RatingSelector.tsx`, `RatingSwitcher.tsx`: UI components for rating selection
  - `PronunciationSwitcher.tsx`: Additional UI component
- **Theme Override**: Custom Root component wraps the entire app with RatingProvider

### Configuration

- **Docusaurus config**: `docusaurus.config.ts` - main site configuration
- **Theme**: Uses classic preset with custom CSS and Mermaid support
- **Deployment**: Configured for GitHub Pages deployment to `gh-pages` branch
- **Tailwind CSS**: Integrated via custom Docusaurus plugin with dark mode support

### File Generation

- **Generator script**: `generate.js` creates new field note posts with proper frontmatter
- **Command alias**: `tsr` script command for generating content

### Tailwind CSS Integration

- **Plugin**: `src/plugins/tailwind-plugin.js` - Custom Docusaurus plugin for Tailwind CSS
- **Config**: `tailwind.config.js` - Configured for Docusaurus dark mode detection using `[data-theme="dark"]`
- **Styles**: `src/css/custom.css` - Includes Tailwind directives and custom CSS variables
- **Dark Mode**: Full dark mode support across all custom components

### PDF Document System

- **PDF Generation**: `@react-pdf/renderer` with build-time generation
  - Corporate document templates with authentic styling
  - Build script: `scripts/generatePdfs.js` - Flexible, data-driven PDF generation
  - Structured data files: `src/data/*.js` (e.g., `pifProcedureData.js`)
  - Configuration-based: Add new PDFs by updating `pdfConfigs` array
  - Integration: `npm run generate-pdfs && docusaurus build`
- **PDF Viewer**: `src/components/PdfViewer.tsx` - Custom viewer with `react-pdf`
  - Advanced zoom controls (50% to 300% range)
  - Responsive default scaling: 50% mobile, 125% desktop
  - Mobile-optimized controls (emoji-free, compact buttons)
  - High z-index layering (`z-50`) for proper overlay behavior
  - Navigation controls for multi-page documents
  - Download functionality with professional styling
- **Content Strategy**: "Leaked document" approach
  - Blog posts focus on investigative narrative and commentary
  - All detailed procedure mechanics contained in generated PDFs
  - Enhanced shareability through official-looking document formatting

#### Adding New Leaked Documents

**Fully Automated Process:**

1. Create data file: `src/data/newDocumentData.js` with structured content
2. Run `npm run generate-pdfs` - PDF auto-discovered and generated!
3. Reference in blog post: `<PdfViewer pdfUrl="/pdf/new-document.pdf" />`

**Auto-Discovery Features:**

- **Zero configuration**: Just drop `.js` files in `/src/data/`
- **Smart naming**: `newDocumentData.js` → `new-document.pdf`
- **Performance**: Hash-based change detection (only regenerates modified content)
- **Scalable**: Handles 1 or 100 PDFs efficiently
- **Error handling**: Gracefully skips malformed files
- **Helper files**: Files starting with `_` are ignored (for utilities)

**⚠️ Deployment Warning**: Always use `npm run deploy` (not `docusaurus deploy`) to ensure PDFs are included in deployment.

#### PDF Footer Implementation Notes

The PDF generation system includes automatic footer branding:

- **Site Address Footer**: Each generated PDF includes "theSludge.report" centered at the bottom of every page
- **Implementation**: Uses `fixed: true` positioning in `@react-pdf/renderer` for reliable cross-page footer placement
- **Known Limitations**:
  - Page numbering with `render` prop is unreliable in Node.js build context
  - Only static text footers work consistently
  - Footer appears separately from disclaimer text (which flows with document content)
- **Location**: Footer logic implemented in `scripts/generatePdfs.js` (not in `/src/utils/` - that path is unused)

### Interactive Components

- **EmailSignup**: Newsletter signup with responsive design and status feedback
- **DietrichTipGenerator**: Animated security tip generator with smooth transitions
- **PasswordComplexityCalculator**: Sophisticated password analyzer with:
  - Real-time visual feedback on input strength
  - Staggered animation sequences for results
  - Dynamic color-coded borders and rings
  - Button loading states with emoji feedback
  - Checkmark reveal animations with 100ms delays
- **SecurityMetricsDashboard**: Real-time metrics dashboard with live data updates
- **PdfViewer**: Professional PDF viewing component with:
  - Responsive zoom defaults (50% mobile, 125% desktop)
  - Mobile-optimized interface (compact, emoji-free controls)
  - Proper z-index layering for overlay behavior
  - Cross-device responsive design with scroll handling
  - Integration with build-time PDF generation

All components feature:

- Comprehensive dark mode support
- Smooth animations and micro-interactions
- Responsive design patterns
- Accessibility considerations

## Troubleshooting

### Windows Development Environment

When working in Git Bash on Windows, some commands require specific syntax:

#### Finding and Killing Dev Server

```bash
# Find process using port 3000
netstat -ano | findstr :3000

# Kill process by PID (use double slashes in Git Bash)
taskkill //PID <process_id> //F
```

#### Process Management

```bash
# List Node.js processes (if needed)
wmic process where "name='node.exe'" get processid,commandline
```

**Note**: Standard Unix-style commands like `taskkill /PID` will fail in Git Bash due to path interpretation. Always use `//` instead of `/` for Windows command flags.

## Security Vulnerabilities

⚠️ **CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES IDENTIFIED** - This blog has multiple attack vectors that could allow malicious actors to modify content and "put words in the author's mouth":

### Repository Access Control

- ~~**No branch protection rules** on main branch - allows direct commits without review~~ **✅ FIXED: Branch protection active** - Main branch now requires pull request reviews before merging
- **Embedded deployment credentials** in package.json scripts (`GIT_USER=justinkowarsch`)
- **Public repository** with potential for unauthorized access

### Content Generation Vulnerabilities

- **Command injection risk** in `generate.js` - user input processed without proper sanitization
- **Path traversal vulnerability** - file paths constructed using unsanitized input
- **Template injection** - content templates include unvalidated user input

### PDF Generation System Exploits

- **Dynamic code execution** - auto-discovery mechanism executes any `.js` file in `/src/data/`
- **Malicious module loading** - `require()` calls on user-controlled file paths
- **Build-time backdoors** - malicious code could execute during PDF generation

### Content Integrity Issues

- **No content signing** - blog posts stored as plain files without integrity verification
- **Direct file modification** - attackers with file system access can modify posts without Git history
- **No input validation** - content generation scripts lack proper input sanitization

### Dependency Vulnerabilities

- **17+ moderate vulnerabilities** in webpack-dev-server and related packages
- **HTTP header manipulation** vulnerabilities in on-headers dependency
- **Source code theft** vulnerabilities in development dependencies

### Deployment Pipeline Risks

- **Build process manipulation** - malicious code could modify content during build
- **Credential exposure** - deployment scripts contain hardcoded usernames
- **No build verification** - no integrity checks on generated content

### Immediate Security Recommendations

1. ~~**Implement branch protection rules** requiring pull request reviews~~ **✅ COMPLETED** - Main branch protection active with required reviews
2. **Add content signing/hashing** for blog post integrity verification
3. **Sanitize all user inputs** in content generation scripts
4. **Sandbox PDF generation process** to prevent code execution
5. **Update vulnerable dependencies** to latest secure versions
6. **Remove embedded credentials** from deployment scripts
7. **Add Git pre-commit hooks** for security validation

### Security Improvements Implemented

- **Branch Protection (2025-07-21)**: Main branch now requires pull request reviews before any changes can be merged. This eliminates the primary attack vector for unauthorized content modification.
